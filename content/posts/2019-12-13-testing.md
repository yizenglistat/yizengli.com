> EDIT: We did it - Sendy has [released a patch](https://sendy.co/get-updated) (v4.0.3.3) for this issue! I recommend upgrading if you're affected. Thanks to Sendy for the quick response to this blog post, and thanks to every reader who helped make this happen.

an attempt to understand what Ben meant. Here's an abbreviated version of the HTML behind that form:

```html
<form action="https://sendy.yizengli.com/subscribe" method="POST">
  <div>
    <label for="name">Name</label>
    <input type="text" name="name" id="name">
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="email">Email</label>
    <input type="email" name="email" id="email">
  </div>
  <input type="hidden" name="list" value="LIST_ID_HERE">
  <input type="hidden" name="subform" value="yes">
  <div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="SITE_KEY_HERE">
    <!-- some more reCAPTCHA stuff here -->
  </div>
  <a>Subscribe to list</a>
</form>
```

The first thing I noticed was the value of the form's `action` attribute: https://sendy.yizengli.com/subscribe. Interestingly enough, that's the exact URL where the official [Sendy API](https://sendy.co/api) lives.

Now, we know the standard subscribe form:

1. Has a working server-side validated reCAPTCHA implementation (I tested it).
2. Uses the official Sendy Subscribe API.

Those two facts refute this claim:

> There's no way to implement Google's reCAPTCHA in an API.

Additionally, why would Ben tell me that reCAPTCHA would "_take effect for for the standard subscribe forms that Sendy provides, not the subscribe API_"?

Did you notice that highlighted line before? Why would the official Sendy form include a hardcoded `subform` field that's not documented in the [Sendy API](https://sendy.co/api)?

You can also [contact me](/about/#contact-me) if you have issues protecting your Sendy subscribe form and I'll do my best to help.

## In Conclusion,

Please don't implement reCAPTCHA like this.
